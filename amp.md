# AMP: Hopes and Fears

<p>These are my notes and comments from the AMP Roadshow in Sunnyvale on April 4.</p>

<p>The questions/issues I have are in bold throughout the rest of the article.</p>

## What problem is AMP trying to solve?

Particularly since the introduction of AMP stories and the losening Javascript restrictions on adding Javascript to AMP content it's starting to look just like another optimized library to create web content and, furthermoer, the AMP cache is starting to look more and more like the old m-dot mobile sites of yesterday.

So it begs the question:

**Beyond performance, what else are we trying to solve with it?**

## User experience

One of the things that bothers me is that AMP looks like it wants to replace most other web technologies that try to improve the user experience.

This is part of a more general question about my wondering why Google competes with itself in so many different categories? In the web space we have at least two competing technologies: AMP and PWA's that live apart or can be forced together in what the AMP team calls Progressive Web AMPs so it begs the first question in this category.

**If this is for best users experiences why not support technologies that enhance what's already there instead of creating something new?**

The AMP team acts as gatekeepers for what is and isn't part of the AMP stack and platform. My problem, for example, is that I can't run the Prism syntax highlighters into AMP code (mine is generated by Wordpress' `wp-amp` plugin compiled from source). It works under normal circumstances when used with non-amp content so why shuold AMP content be any different?

**Since we can't use Javascript on AMP content, how can we leverage web APIs? I understand that you're working on relaxing the restriction of using Javascript in AMP content and experimenting with using workers to offload running scripts (amp-script) but, right now, I can't use any APIs that the AMP team doesn't allow. How is that putting users first?**

I think I figured out the cause but not the reasoning behind it. Until the AMP team relaxes the restrictions for scripts on AMP content the custom elements that make the AMP HTML vocabulary do not accept scripts so whenever scripts needs to inject content into the page they will fail and the content will not render as expected.

In my case with my code highlights I still get something that looks different enough from my content to be distinguishable from prose but not what I expected as syntax highlighted code.

The last bit is actually two parts intertwined together.

**Who answers if there's a problem?**

Unless you make your AMP content fully and deliberately accessible, users will only see it when they arrive to it from a link that uses AMP or from a search engine result. At first I started asking myself why bother?

Most people won't bother to check the search console to see if there is a problem with search and AMP or know how to fix it (I have a problem with linked data being wrong but since I didn't write the plugin or the AMP tags being used to generate it, I have no idea about how to solve the problem) so having AMP working is not guarantee that the tool is working properly, or at all.

So whose fault is it? Mine? The plugin developer? The AMP team?

**This is only applicable for large hosted sites but what effect does poor content have on AMP search rankings?**

I host my own installation of Wordpress so this is less of an issue for me. But for the people who host content in Wordppress dot com this may come in as a surprise: **_AMP is enabled by default!_** (see [AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)](https://en.support.wordpress.com/amp-accelerated-mobile-pages/) in the Wordpress dot com support site).

Twitter is also sending users to AMP version of the content (when available) by default. **Shouldn't this be an opt in experience rather than opt out or no choice at all?**

So we have situations where the AMP content matches the canonical content, AMP is not the canonical content, and where there is no quality control for the content that gets higer in the Google search results because it uses AMP. Who wins in this scenario?

## Duplicating effort?

When AMP first came out as a mobile optimization library I had my reservations but saw it as an interim solution to the mobile performance issues that I see documented everywhere and that have gotten progressively worse.

But it's not about improving mobile performance anymore.

The concept of _amp stories_ and the associated elements that we must use to build them are a completely different concept and, to be honest, they frighten the hell out of me.

The concept of stories at least according to the news I've read out there, throws the concept of non-AMP sites out the window. **If there is no equivalency check, what will search engines do when the content is different? Which version of the content will get priority?**

According to [Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/amp-stories-new-accelerated-mobile-pages-format-google-291907):

> Breaking with previous guidance, Google does not intend for this type of AMP content to match your non-mobile content. Instead, this mobile-only content should be unique. I followed up on this point with a Google rep, who characterized AMP Story content this way:
>
> > AMP stories is all about encouraging new forms of expression and storytelling, so we expect most publishers to not be already publishing this kind of content out on the web currently. AMP stories is meant to facilitate this and make it easier.
>
> The rep also added that “AMP Story content should be fulfilling and standalone.”
>
> Because Google has historically argued specifically against creating different content for different users, this new “separate but equal” stance surprised me. Google further explained:
>
> > This does not run counter to the idea that the publisher may also have separate expressions [of] similar content published. Say a publisher has a long-form analysis article about college admissions data. Then, say they have a companion piece that’s an interactive experience letting people play with the data through charts and other visualizations. It wouldn’t be correct to call the long-form piece the canonical for the interactive. They each stand on their own, although being related.

This bothers me in so many levels but I'll start with the most basic concern and fear: Are we turning the mobile web into a single vendor experience? Will this force other search engines into playing the AMP game or be left behind?

How about leveraging other parts of the web platform to tell the same type of stories you do with AMP? Again, isn't improving the whole web experience the name of the game?

**Who is AMP competing with? Inside Google? Outside?**

I've always wondered how can Google support so many technologies that, some times, compete with each other. Some of the specific questions I have:

* Can you generate AMP HTML from an Angular application? If not then how do I provide an AMP alternative for an Angular application?
* How does AMP coexist with Polymer elements and elements created with other web-components frameworks?

Outside competition is easier to measure. Facebook and Apple each has their own content format to enable easy agregation. Facebook uses its platform for delivery and Apple leverages the News App in iOS.

We can ask the same question we asked about Angular for any other framework available in the Market

## Technical questions

There are technical questions that came up when researching AMP and writing this post a few more technical questions

### Converting your content?

In talking to people at the Roadshow I now understand that AMP is a testbed to make things better and then bring it back to the wider web community; this is an important goal. I just have issues with the way AMP is doing this.

The example below is a basic sample HTML document conforming to the AMP HTML specification.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html amp>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Sample document</title>
    <link rel="canonical" href="./regular-html-version.html">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1">
    <style amp-custom>
      h1 {color: red}
    </style>
    <script type="application/ld+json">
    {
      "@context": "http://schema.org",
      "@type": "NewsArticle",
      "headline": "Article headline",
      "image": [
        "thumbnail1.jpg"
      ],
      "datePublished": "2015-02-05T08:00:00+08:00"
    }
    </script>
    <script async custom-element="amp-carousel" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-carousel-0.1.js"></script>
    <style amp-boilerplate>body{-webkit-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;-moz-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;-ms-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both}@-webkit-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-moz-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-ms-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-o-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}</style><noscript><style amp-boilerplate>body{-webkit-animation:none;-moz-animation:none;-ms-animation:none;animation:none}</style></noscript>
    <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Sample document</h1>
    <p>
      Some text
      <amp-img src=sample.jpg width=300 height=300></amp-img>
    </p>
    <amp-ad width=300 height=250
        type="a9"
        data-aax_size="300x250"
        data-aax_pubname="test123"
        data-aax_src="302">
    </amp-ad>
  </body>
</html>
```

Some of the requirements and limitations of AMP are not evident. According to [AMP HTML Specification](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/fundamentals/spec) an AMP document must:

* start with the doctype `<!doctype html>`
* contain a top-level `<html ⚡>` tag `(<html amp>` is accepted as well)
* contain `<head>` and `<body>` tags (They are optional in HTML)
* contain a `<link rel="canonical" href="$SOME_URL">` tag inside their head that points to the regular HTML version of the AMP HTML document or to itself if no such HTML version exists
* contain a `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag as the first child of their head tag
* contain a `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1">` tag inside their head tag. It's also recommended to include initial-scale=1
* contain a `<script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>` tag inside their head tag
* contain the AMP boilerplate code (`head > style[amp-boilerplate]` and `noscript > style[amp-boilerplate]`) in their head tag

If this was all that AMP required for compliance I'd be ok. I've always been a gun-ho fan of proper page structure and including the appropriate elements where they should be. Death to tagsoup markup!

I love the idea of having metadata inlined in the document. This makes it eaasier to support in the long run.

I may even forgive the extra attribute (other than class) in the html element.

But this is just the beginning.

Amp not only requires a certain structure from your HTML page but it changes some elements for AMP-specific ones and completely disaallows others. I'm mostly OK with the tag it forbids as they are mostly legacy elements that have been kept on the specifications for legacy compatibility reasons. I mean, seriously, frameset and frames? It's 2018 people... we have better ways of doing that!

The table below (also from the [AMP HTML Specification](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/fundamentals/spec)) explains the limitations and changes that AMP makes to standard HTML elements. Some of these changes help explain the structure of the example page seen earlier.

But it's the changes that they make to standard HTML elements that worry me. Do we really need an image custom element? video? audio?

I don't think this solves the underlying problems of the web. It doesn't change the fact that loading speed numbers are getting slower, not faster for the mobile web.

See the HTTP Archive [comparison data between January 1, 2017 and March 15, 2018](https://httparchive.org/reports/loading-speed?start=2017_01_01&end=latest) for an idea of what I'm talking about.

It doesn't change the fact that we still have megabytes of images (not all of them compressed), several hundred KBs of fonts, and huge bundles of Javascript that will take tens of seconds to load and unblock page rendering.

There are many more solutions outside of AMP that will give you performant web content. I think the biggest issue is that people may not know or may not care about these new technologies and smaller libraries that will take care of some performance bottlenecks.

### Generating AMP?

Hand writing AMP is different than writing HTML but how do we generate AMP when working with CMS other than Wordpress? How much do we need to retool our systems based on the restrictions imposed by AMP?

Condé Nast has published information on [how they generate the AMP content](https://technology.condenast.com/story/evolving-google-amp-at-conde-nast) for each of their publications: Allure, Architectural Digest, Ars Technica, Backchannel, Bon Appétit, Brides, Condé Nast Traveler, Epicurious, Glamour, Golf Digest, GQ, Pitchfork, Self, Teen Vogue, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Vogue, W and Wired.

Their system is failry intricate as the image below illustrates:

<figure>
  <img src='https://media.condenast.io/photos/59a57e16cf742825d0b02891/master/w_680/AMP-Arch.png' alt='AMP Generation Process at Condé Nast'>
  <figcaption>AMP Generation Process at Condé Nast. From <a href="https://technology.condenast.com/story/the-why-and-how-of-google-amp-at-conde-nast">The Why and How of Google AMP at Condé Nast</a></figcaption>
</figure>

And the AMP generation process itself looks like it's rather complex, running from Markdown to React that then converts the Markdown content into valid AMP HTML:

<figure>
  <img src='https://media.condenast.io/photos/59a57e3dcf742825d0b02893/master/w_680/AMP-Pipeline.png' alt='alt-text'>
  <figcaption>Condé Nast AMP Service Pipeline. From <a href="https://technology.condenast.com/story/the-why-and-how-of-google-amp-at-conde-nast">The Why and How of Google AMP at Condé Nast</a></figcaption>
</figure>

So now we have to insert a way to identify when we want our CMS to serve AMP content and an AMP conversion process into our pipeline... but only for our mobile content, right? I go back to the question I asked earlier about creating AMP/mobile only sites: Are they necessary?

Furthermore, I'm concerned about the ammount of work needed to get AMP into a CMS. If you're not using a commercially available platform, how do you build AMP in addition to the standard content? As we saw in `Converting your content?` the restrictions of an AMP page are different than those of normal HTML (even if some of the restrictions are sensible and make sense).

Another thing that comes to mind when it comes to generating AMP programmatically is how much of the CSS we use in our normal site can we use with AMP?

The AMP specification requires developers to use no more than 50kb of CSS and, on its face, it's a sensible requirement until we realize that CSS animations and any extra prefixing we need to acomodate browser idiosyncracies would also fall under that limitation and we need to decide early on how will we make the CSS fit into the 50KB requirements or how much to take out to make the CSS fit the size restriction and still keep branding folks happy.

Same thing with Javascript.

### CORS for my own site?

One of the biggest issues is hosting the content in a Google-based and supported CDN. This causes the large, ugly URLs (like `https://www-gq-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.gq.com/story/gq-eye-exclusive-fatherhood-style-series---todd-snyder` or `https://www-gq-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.gq.com/`) but also has an interesting side effect that makes CORS necessary for your own content.

When you go to a site, for example: `https://www.gq.com/story/gq-eye-exclusive-fatherhood-style-series---todd-snyder` in a mobile device it'll redirect you to the version hosted in the AMP CDN which turns into `https://www-gq-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.gq.com/story/gq-eye-exclusive-fatherhood-style-series---todd-snyder` and caches it to guarantee preloads and seemingly instant first load experiences.

But what happens if you need to load data for your application? Say you want to load product data for your shopping cart, or a tour date list for your favorite band? Those are stored on your server, not the cache and for them to work properly you need to set CORS headers on them so they will work for origins other than yours.

On a side note, if you hit the AMP cache URL from a desktop browser it will redirect you to the desktop, however, if you hit an AMP link using an activation script like `https://www.gq.com/story/gq-eye-exclusive-fatherhood-style-series---todd-snyder/amp` it will take you to the AMP version, regardless of platform or form factor.

### Performance

People have been working with performance for years. The early work Ilia Grigorik and Addy Osmani did and continue to do at Google, tools like UNCSS, the fact that we can precache and preload content, the fact that we have PWA and its component technologiies available within and outside PWAs, among other things, really makes me wonder how lazy we've become as developers.

Nothing that AMP does is new and most of those techniques are available to most browsers (old and evergreen) right now. I strongly believe it's the search carrot that brings people to AMP, not the technology itself.

I'll take three examples of things we can do now to make experiences better without AMP: Image Optimization, Resource Pioritization and Service Workers.

We know that images make up for a large fraction of what gets pushed into a web page, we don't evangelize tools like [Imagemin](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin) and workflows that use these tools to generate smaller images.

**_Does `amp-image` really reduce the bloat problem?_**

It is not hard to create a good [resource prioritization](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/resource-prioritization) strategy using a combination of H2 Push, link preload, prefetch, prerender and dns-prefetch to load resources the way we want them to. If we compare this with lazy loading content so they will only load when needed, we have a much better web experience.

Service workers can also help improve performance of your web content. We can use it to keep a persistent cache of content for our site or application that can be populated and expired as needed. Libraries like [Workbok.js](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) can help us make this process easier.

I recently came accross Tim Kladec's [How Fast Is Amp Really?](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2018-03-19-how-fast-is-amp-really/) performance analysis of AMP content served in different ways:

1. How well does AMP perform in the context of Google search?
2. How well does the AMP library perform when used as a standalone framework?
3. How well does AMP perform when the library is served using the AMP cache?
4. How well does AMP perform compared to the canonical article?

His findings mirror my opinion about AMP not doing anything that we can't do in the open web. To me, the most, important section of Tim's article is when he talks about weight reduction:

> The 90th percentile weight for the canonical version is 5,229kb. The 90th percentile weight for AMP documents served from the same origin is 1,553kb— a savings of around 70% in page weight. The 90th percentile request count for the canonical version is 647, for AMP documents it’s 151. That’s a reduction of nearly 77%.
>
> AMP’s restrictions mean less stuff. It’s a concession publishers are willing to make in exchange for the enhanced distribution Google provides, but that they hesitate to make for their canonical versions.
>
> If we’re grading AMP on the goal of making the web faster, the evidence isn’t particularly compelling. Every single one of these publishers has an AMP version of these articles in addition to a non-AMP version.
>
> From: [How Fast Is Amp Really?](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2018-03-19-how-fast-is-amp-really/)

AMP restricts what you can do with Javascript and what you can do with custom AMP elements restricts what you can do on your pages and, regardless of the reasons why you put the restrictions in place, it shouldn't be up to a library or framework to dictate how much stuff you put in a page but it's up to the designers and developers to slim down their content.

## Conclusion

I wrote the tweet below as a response to my original tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No, <a href="https://twitter.com/AMPhtml?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AMPhtml</a> hasn’t fully sold me on it. Too many open issues in AMP that are easy to do in non-amp.

As I've mentioned throughout this post the technology behind AMP is not revolutionary. It's a reaction to a problem on the mobile web and it has been taken as a way to gate keep and restrict what can be done on the web.

There are many unanswered questions about AMP and the direction it's going on. The [roadmap](https://www.ampproject.org/roadmap/) and it's [Q2 Update](https://www.ampproject.org/latest/blog/amp-roadmap-update-for-end-of-q2/) are clear on the features they are implementing but not on how do new developers choose whether to opt in to AMP altogherther or the new features.

Attempting to make AMP the canonical version of your web content worries me. I mentioned earlier but having Amp Stories be completely different to any non-amp alternatives makes me worry about which version of an amp-story will the Google Crawler run if there are two related stories.

It also worries me because if we make AMP the cannonical version of our content then it won't be long before people say why should we have to worry about non-amp content?

I'll keep my mind open towards AMP (after all I still provide AMP for my blog content to help people with slow connections or who may have data cost issues) but there are too many open questions about the platform and its direction before I can say I agree with their assessment of moving the web forward.
